\title{Deterministic simulation of SEIT2L model}
\usage{
SEIT2L_simulateDeterministic(theta, init.state, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{named numeric vector. Parameter values. Must include the following parameters: "R0", "D.lat", "D.inf", "alpha", "D.imm" and "rho"}

\item{init.state}{named numeric vector. Initial state of the SEIT2L model. Must include the following states: "S", "E", "I", "T1", "T2", "L" and "Inc".}

\item{times}{numeric vector. Time sequence for which state of the model is wanted; the first value of times must be the initial time, i.e. the time of \code{init.state}.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.fame} containing the simulated trajectories that is the values of the state variables (1 per column) at each observation time (1 per row). The first column is \code{time}.
}
\description{
Solves the system of ordinary differential equations for the SEIT2L model using the \code{\link[deSolve]{ode}} function.
}
\note{
The incidence \code{init.state[["Inc"]]} will be set to 0 at the start of the simulation and computed for each time interval of the vector \code{times}.
For instance, if \code{times} contains daily time steps, then the returned data frame will contain daily incidence.
